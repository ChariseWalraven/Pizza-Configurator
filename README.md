## :large_blue_diamond: In Progress!

## Quickstart :rocket:

 1. clone this repo
 2. run `postintall`
 3. happy hacking! :ok_hand:

> You're asked to create a pizza configurator for NewAgePizza.com, a new and hip venture to get your pizza. It should be a single page that contains all the following elements. 

> First you pick your base. You have four options:

> 1. 25cm NY Style € 8,99
> 2. 30cm NY Style € 11,49
> 3. 35cm NY Style € 13,49
> 4. 20cm NY Style € 6,45

> After that you pick your sauce options:

> 1. White sauce
> 2. Red sauce
> 3. Double red sauce € 1,00
> 4. Mix it up € 1,50 

> After that you pick one or more toppings:

> 1. Pineapple
> 2. Corn
> 3. Olives (green)
> 4. Red unioun
> 5. Spinach
> 6. Cherry tomatoes
> 7. Chicken

> _Rules: max. 3 toppings, toppings cost € 0,50 apiece_

> Last but not least, you can choose turbo-drone-delivery which is an additional 10% on top of the total pizza price. 

> Make sure you can change previous steps even if you already changed stuff before. So I could pick a base, a sauce and a topping and switch the base after that. 

> Additional instructions:

> 1. If any base is picked there should always be a price shown for the total pizza. 
> 2. The redux store should contain the state of the pizza
> 3. You don't need any backend connection
> 4. Make sure you split your app into separate components
> 5. We expect you to use [controlled form components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) as they are the best practise

> Bonus points if you use [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com) (v1)
